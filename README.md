### SafeFood

We are the "Food Safe" team.
Our challenge is food for thought.
One in ten people get sick from contaminated food.
In times of pandemic, this concern increases.
Our "safe food" application provides information on the route taken by the products you consume,
from its production to the moment of its acquisition.
All this thanks to a Blockchain structure, the use of smart contracts and the application of satellite APIs for mapping.

Allowing to generate control, trust and security over the food you buy.
